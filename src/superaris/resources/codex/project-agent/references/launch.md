# Launch the installed SuperARIS product

Use the installed `superaris` console command. With the same environment's
interpreter, `python -m superaris` is equivalent; replace the command prefix in
examples rather than putting a multiword shell command into an executable-path
variable. Do not locate the product under `$ARIS_REPO/tools/` or require
`~/.aris/repo`. Those legacy helper pointers are not product installation.

## Source and requirements

The runtime requires Python ≥3.10 on macOS, Linux or native Windows, a supported workbench
(Herdr by default, or Orca), and the selected native CLIs. For Orca-specific
terminal/runtime checks read [orca-host.md](orca-host.md). On Windows use Windows Terminal / PowerShell;
Herdr supplies ConPTY panes, and SuperARIS uses kernel file locks, raw NDJSON
named pipes and a detached receiver. For a Herdr-bound launch, confirmed startup can install missing
Herdr with its official PowerShell installer. Chooser screens and cancellation
do not install dependencies or fetch ARIS. Use their own model/login configuration; detecting
an executable does not verify authentication or model access. No model probes,
credentials requests, global skills installation or model/MCP rewrites are needed.

The package bundles this project-agent resource. Other ARIS skills, catalogs,
shared references and helpers come from public MIT-licensed ARIS commit
`8f493923f28c3f991dcca1287db97aa780d0969b`, fetched lazily only when confirmed
startup or context preparation needs it. The cache is
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/superaris/aris/<commit>`, falling back to
`~/.cache/superaris/aris/<commit>`. Help, plan and canceled chooser flows do not
fetch it. Use an explicit complete ARIS checkout with:

```bash
SUPERARIS_ARIS_REPO=/path/to/aris superaris
superaris start /path/to/project --aris-repo /path/to/aris --plan
```

In PowerShell, assign `$env:SUPERARIS_ARIS_REPO = "C:\Research Tools\aris"`
before running `superaris`, or pass `--aris-repo "C:\Research Tools\aris"`.
Quote paths containing spaces or CJK characters. Bash environment-assignment
syntax above is for Unix shells. Upstream skills may still need Bash, GPU,
SSH, LaTeX or other tools; inspect their requirements separately and use a
suitable host or WSL when needed. Product startup is not proof that every
ARIS helper is Windows-compatible.

A bound project's `aris_repo` retains the chosen source for later context.
Ambient `ARIS_REPO` is for canonical ARIS helpers, not product source discovery.
When executing such a helper, use the chosen checkout's host-correct resolver
and actual canonical helper root in that same invocation. Never replace the
product's own executable with an assumed ARIS `tools/aris` wrapper. Source
updates require an explicit checkout or a future product pin change.

## Start and resume

Run `superaris` (or `superaris start` without a project) in an interactive
terminal. First choose 简体中文 / English, then project, available client
combination (three recommended presets or Custom team), models per role, layout and optional task. Review the summary and
launch, edit or cancel. New directories are created only after confirmation;
new empty tasks wait for the user. EOF/noninteractive input does not auto-start.
UI language controls product text/new labels, not paper/task output or native
client UI. It saves on confirmation; existing bound labels are preserved.

A bound project first offers its original owner/session/models/roles/tasks.
Omitted explicit parameters preserve existing inputs; `--clear-recovery`
explicitly clears recovery. Native trust/login stays human-operated. Startup
can continue while the selected workbench stays open once the user clears a native wait. Keep
original owners, writing scopes and unknown delivery state; do not resend an
uncertain initial prompt. A changed owner requires explicit reconciliation.

New projects can select Orca with `--host orca`; existing projects retain their
bound host and team. A binding without a host field remains Herdr. Read the
packet/navigation host instructions before workbench operations.

Every recommended preset starts `main`, `engineer` and `writer`: `codex` maps all
three to Codex; `cc-codex` uses CC / Codex / CC; `cc-codex-agy` uses
CC / Codex / AGY. Role, harness and model are separate; CC does not imply a
particular provider. The visible `writer` role is Research & Writing: methods,
argument and substantive prose. Collaborators read their own context and wait
for an assignment from main. Once assigned, independent research can run
alongside engineering.
The presets are shortcuts, not restrictions: Custom team independently selects Codex,
CC or AGY for each role and keeps separate sessions/models. At least one installed
agent client is enough, without requiring Codex. For example:

```bash
superaris start /path/to/project --role main=agy --role engineer=claude --role writer=agy --plan
```

Add `--host orca` for a new Orca workbench. Main owns goals, delegation,
acceptance and follow-up; it may also execute or code within authorization and
its write scope. Explicitly automation-owned Codex and Herdr AGY roles support
automatic continuation when idle with a verified empty input. CC and Orca AGY
follow-up remains visible-notice based. Use the existing `control` handoff or
new-role `--automation-owned` option; choosing AGY alone grants no automation.
Ordinary reentry retains recorded or pending membership. Repeat `--only-role`
to explicitly select a subset, as in this two-role example:

```bash
superaris start /path/to/project --session research-demo --preset cc-codex --only-role main --only-role engineer --write-scope main=notes --write-scope engineer=outputs/engineer --role-task 'engineer=Analyze existing results into outputs/engineer' --task 'Coordinate the existing project task' --plan
```

Use `--skill NAME` repeatedly for pipeline/workflow/individual selections,
`--model ROLE=MODEL` for new-role requests and `--name TEXT` for new readable
workbench titles. The AGY wizard offers Argon High, Carbon High and Hydrogen High shortcuts
(`gemini-4-argon-high`, `gemini-4-carbon-high`, `gemini-4-hydrogen-high`)
for any AGY role, alongside native settings and a manually entered ID. Native
settings remain the default; returning to a selection retains its chosen model.
Actual model identity comes from native results. Scopes are
ownership instructions, not an OS sandbox. Adopted owners retain their topology;
new-only layouts are described in [layouts.md](layouts.md).

## Context and continuity

```bash
superaris context /path/to/project --role main --skill research-pipeline
superaris context /path/to/project --role engineer --skill analyze-results
```

`context` adds skills to the binding's original source/task/recovery/scope and
catalog closure. Optional `--task` describes only that preparation. It sends no
input and leaves live binding, assignment, delivery and unknown state unchanged.
A file-only role can request preparation from its main owner. Read actual
selected `SKILL.md` resources before executing them, not catalog summaries alone.

Role-local role/navigation/recovery files and exact `skill_index` point to
host-correct material. `.aris/workbench/RECOVERY.md` points to original project
records and the binding; `context/ROLE/LATEST_PREPARED.md` locates preparation,
not delivery, active assignment or acceptance. Native project instruction
pointers retain user text (Codex AGENTS/override precedence, CC CLAUDE, AGY
GEMINI). Current sessions must explicitly reread them; no permanent model
memory is promised. Keep original owners, wiki/task records, pauses and budgets.

For registered results, explicit memory events and delivery resolution, read
[receipts.md](receipts.md); for cooperation read
[coordination.md](coordination.md). The receiver survives detach/no-attach while
bound to the original main; it stops on owner ending/changing, server loss or
explicit stop. No global restarter or replacement owner is created. Never run
legacy and independent receiver versions on the same active project.
