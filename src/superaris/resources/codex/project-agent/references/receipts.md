# Registered results and explicit memory events

Use the installed product command as described in [launch.md](launch.md). All commands below target the
same existing project. `notes/WORK.md` and `notes/PROGRESS.md` illustrate its
existing task and memory records; use the real paths rather than creating a
second ledger. The original record is a preferred pointer, never parsed as a
task database. Transport handle IDs identify one waiting item, not a scientific
state machine.

## A complete receiving chain

New workbenches default to `main`, `engineer` and `writer`. The example below
explicitly selects an owner and one collaborator with distinct assignments and
disjoint write directories by repeating `--only-role`.
Without a `--role-task`, a collaborator reads context and waits for a scoped
assignment. `--write-scope` supplies an ownership instruction, not an OS sandbox.

```bash
superaris start /path/to/project --session research-demo --preset cc-codex --only-role main --only-role engineer --write-scope main=notes --write-scope engineer=outputs/engineer --skill analyze-results --task 'Coordinate the existing notes/WORK.md task and verify the result' --role-task 'engineer=Wait until the owner registers demo-check; analyze the existing results, write outputs/engineer/RESULT.md, then report through the registered handle' --no-attach

superaris watch /path/to/project --id demo-check --owner-role main --worker-role engineer --record notes/WORK.md --deliverable outputs/engineer/RESULT.md --watch-file notes/WORK.md --wait-for 'Result file and worker report' --query 'engineer role; outputs/engineer/RESULT.md; original worker continuation handle' --next 'Read the result, run the original acceptance check and update notes/WORK.md within its existing authority'

# The worker runs this after writing its actual output.
superaris report /path/to/project --id demo-check --outcome completed --message 'Result written to outputs/engineer/RESULT.md; inspect the file and original checks'

# Verify the project-bound receiver; it survives UI detach/no-attach.
superaris receiver /path/to/project --action status
```

Startup ensures a receiver subprocess bound to this project and its original
main identity, including with `--no-attach`. Detaching the UI or exiting the
launcher leaves that receiver active. It uses the bound host's receiving mechanism and
reconciles registered files/reports without polling an idle model. It stops if
the expected main ends/changes, the bound host runtime becomes unavailable, or the
owner explicitly stops it. It does not rebuild a server, follow a replacement
main, create panes or install a global permanent daemon.

```bash
superaris receiver /path/to/project --action status
superaris receiver /path/to/project --action stop
# Explicitly re-enable after stopping/disabling and verifying the owner:
superaris receiver /path/to/project --action start
```

`start --no-receiver` disables/stops receiving and persists that choice;
`receiver --action start` explicitly re-enables it. `listen` remains a bounded
foreground diagnostic; its single-receiver lock refuses a second listener when
the managed receiver is active. Native callbacks can supply the same receipts
where available. Receiving transport remains separate from original acceptance,
Goal Pulse and the human/automation handoff.
Before dispatching deferred work, re-read the original task and current files;
a stale cached prompt must not override changed ownership, authorization or
newer evidence. Unknown delivery still requires readback resolution, and a
human draft still revokes automation.

`--query` is a display-only pointer to the original worker/MCP query entry;
it is never shell-executed and defines no generic MCP job/status API. Keep the
original MCP job/thread protocol, session continuation and reviewer freshness.
`--deliverable` and `--watch-file` can be repeated. Their paths and `--record`
stay inside the selected project. A record must already exist. Omit
`--worker-role` for a result owned by an original external worker whose query
handle remains in the record.

`report` also supports `failed`, `blocked` and `reply`. Every report is a signal
with acceptance unevaluated. Inspect real files, command outcomes and completed
reviewer replies before acting. The default human-owned role receives a visible
notice; it does not automatically execute the next step. `--automation-owned`
is an explicit startup option for new dedicated automation roles; use `control`
for an existing role. Codex and Herdr AGY can receive automatic follow-up when
the original owner is idle and its verified input is empty. The delivery
surface check is a best-effort guard, not atomic protection against concurrent
human typing; keep humans out of dedicated automation panes. An uncertain or
human-owned input state remains notice-only. Do not count notification as an
executed follow-up or acceptance.

After disconnects or lost events, inspect the original handles/files and use:

```bash
superaris reconcile /path/to/project

# Only when the original evidence shows this wait has ended:
superaris acknowledge /path/to/project --id demo-check --evidence notes/WORK.md
```

`reconcile` performs one receiving pass; `acknowledge` closes only the transport
wait and points to an existing evidence file. Neither declares scientific PASS.
Keep the handle open while more evidence is expected. Do not blindly replay a
write or paid model call after an uncertain delivery.

## SSH results

Use the original task record to make the remote execution and local receipt
explicit. For example, adapt these fields to the already authorized project:

- **Owner:** the existing engineer; main assigns and accepts the work, writer
  waits for verified results.
- **Remote:** SSH alias `research-box`, authorized directory `/srv/research/study`,
  existing environment `/srv/envs/study/bin/python` and the project's known
  small-run command recorded in `notes/WORK.md`. Reuse that entry rather than
  rebuilding an environment just because product metadata is absent.
- **First milestone:** one smallest real experiment with its actual command,
  exit status, run log and result; an environment import alone is not that result.
- **Receipt:** remote artifacts returned to `outputs/engineer/smoke/RESULT.md`
  and `outputs/engineer/smoke/run.log` in the selected project, through the
  existing artifact-sync entry recorded in the same task. Retain the original
  SSH/job status or MCP continuation entry and the agreed troubleshooting limit.

Register the local wait before dispatching that work package:

```bash
superaris watch /path/to/project --id ssh-smoke --owner-role main --worker-role engineer --record notes/WORK.md --deliverable outputs/engineer/smoke/RESULT.md --deliverable outputs/engineer/smoke/run.log --wait-for 'First real experiment, synced result and command/exit-status log' --query 'engineer: original SSH/job status entry in notes/WORK.md' --next 'Verify the actual files and first experiment against notes/WORK.md, then continue the authorized stage'

# Engineer: after the existing sync entry has returned the actual local files.
superaris report /path/to/project --id ssh-smoke --outcome completed --message 'Result and run log synced to outputs/engineer/smoke; inspect the command, exit status and original checks'
```

The receiver observes registered files on its own host and explicit reports;
it does not watch arbitrary SSH files, run `--query`, or synchronize artifacts.
A result remaining only on the remote machine needs the existing worker's
sync/status action. If it cannot be returned, report `blocked` or `reply` with
the remote evidence and original query entry; main still needs actual evidence
before acceptance. Reports, native idle and notices alone are not completion.
CC and Orca AGY follow-up remains visible-notice based. Dedicated Codex and
Herdr AGY automatic inputs retain the original ownership, permission and draft
guards; an unknown outcome is inspected rather than resent.

## Hand off input and resolve uncertain delivery

```bash
# Persist an explicit input-ownership handoff for a verified role.
superaris control /path/to/project --role main --mode human
# Only after human drafts are absent and the role is dedicated to automation:
superaris control /path/to/project --role main --mode automation

# After actual readback, point to its existing evidence file:
superaris resolve-delivery /path/to/project --role main --resolution received --evidence notes/RECEIPT.md
# For an uncertain bridge delivery, use --handle demo-check instead of --role.
```

`start --automation-owned` applies only to new roles; it never elevates an
adopted owner. Observing a draft revokes automation. Clear/read back the input
and explicitly opt back in with `control` before automatic delivery can resume.
The surface guard is not atomic protection against concurrent typing.

A submitted context remains `pending_context` until an explicit `received`
resolution references actual readback evidence. For confirmed non-delivery use
`--resolution not-delivered`; inspect first, then choose the next authorized
operation. Unknown delivery does not trigger automatic resend or repeated
confirmation requests. Resolve the uncertainty from actual state. Receipt of a
context is separate from acceptance under the original scientific gate.

## Append an explicit event to existing memory

The authorized owner can write the existing source directly or use:

```bash
superaris remember /path/to/project --file notes/PROGRESS.md --kind delivery --scope 'existing results task' --source outputs/engineer/RESULT.md --text 'Verified result using the original check; next action is recorded in notes/WORK.md'
```

`remember` appends the supplied event to an existing authoritative project file;
it does not infer preferences, inspect evidence for truth or update a wiki graph
automatically. Kinds are `correction`, `decision`, `delivery`, `failure` and
`handoff`. Supply `--expected-mtime-ns` from the owner's most recent file read
when protecting against intervening edits; a mismatch requires rereading before
appending. Keep personal preferences, project facts and task status in their
existing domains. Neither receipts nor memory commands resume Goals, expand
budgets, publish or merge.
